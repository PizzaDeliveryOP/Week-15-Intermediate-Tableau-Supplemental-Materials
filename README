A successful analysis of where best to live when working a Data Anaylsis position should include more data than just Cost of Living and Earnings. 

I included in my analysis: 
  The State of Democracy - Global Democracy Index
  https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-state-of-global-democracy-2022/
  This was included as there is a tendency for authoritarian regimes to interfere in the lives of Data Analysts, as well as requiring their data to 
  fit a narrative. A country with a better Democracy Index is less likely to interfere in my work
  
  The 2022 Global Peace Index
  https://www.visionofhumanity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GPI-2022-web.pdf
  This was included because a nation that is frequently at war or under attack increases the tendency that a draft or stray anti-ship missile could interfere 
  with my work. Combining this data with the Global Democracy highlights countries such as Finland that have one of the highest Democracy Indexes, but 
  share a border with Russia, which as of the time of this writing is involved in invading a soverign nation. This could prove risky for living in Finland
  in the future
